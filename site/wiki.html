                    <h3>About SyncBlue</h3>
                    <p>SyncBlue is a cross-platform program that allows file and folder synchronization via Bluetooth.
                    It is open source and published under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt">GNU General Public License</a>.</p>
                    <h3>Compatible target devices</h3>
                    <p>Target device compatibility is platform-independent; it is, in principle, possible to connect to Bluetooth-enabled devices of any operating system.
                    However, the target device must support Bluetooth pairing and the OBEX File Transfer protocol.
                    Note: Windows computers support OBEX File Transfer but do not advertise (broadcast) it. Windows computers cannot (yet) be
                    connected to through SyncBlue (but it is possible to install SyncBlue on Windows and connect to non-Windows devices).</p>
                    <a name="windows"><h2>Microsoft Windows</h2></a>
                    <h3>System requirements</h3>
                    <p>Windows 7 or higher (64-bit).</p>
                    <h3>Installation</h3>
                    <p>Download the <a href="downloads.html">installer</a>. Run it and follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
                    <h3>Usage & options</h3>
                    <h4>Connecting to a device</h4>
                    <p>Most (but not all) target devices will only accept an incoming Bluetooth
                    connection if the device has been paired with your computer. Therefore, before
                    you attempt to establish a connection through SyncBlue, ensure that your
                    computer and your device are paired.
                    
                    When SyncBlue is launched for the first time, the dropdown menu next to the
                    "add device" button will be empty. To add a device, simply click "add device" and
                    enter the Bluetooth name (not MAC address) of the target device when prompted.
                    SyncBlue will save all added devices fur future use.
                    Devices can always be added and removed in the settings.
                    
                    Select the device to connect to from the dropdown menu and click on "find services".
                    If your device supports OBEX file transfer, "OBEX File Transfer" should appear
                    in the box. If it does not, make sure Bluetooth is turned on both on your computer
                    and on the target device, that the target device is within range ( < 5 m.)
                    and that your target device is discoverable and can accept incoming connection requests.
                    If the problem persists, your target device does not support OBEX file transfer
                    and is incompatible with SyncBlue. Windows computers do not advertise OBEX file transfer
                    out of the box and are thus (still) not suitable as target devices.</p>
                    <h4>Synchronization</h4>
                    <p>The default sync mode is "one-way sync". To change the sync mode, click "Settings".</p>
                    <p>One-way sync and two-way sync require the user to specify a sync folder on the
                    home device (i.e. the computer running SyncBlue) and remote sync folder on the target device.
                    It is possible to specify a target folder that does not exist yet.
                    As long as the parent directory exists, SyncBlue will create the sync folder at the desired
                    location.</p>
                    <h5>One-way sync</h5>
                    <p>By default, keeps the contents of the target folder identical to those on the home
                    folder, i.e. deletes all contents of the target folder and replaces them with the
                    contents of the home folder. The sync direction can be changed in the settings.</p>
                    <h5>Two-way sync</h5>
                    <p>Synchronizes the target and the home folder, i.e. keeps the most recent files and adds
                    files and folders to either folder that are not present in the other folder. Does not
                    delete files unless there is a more recent file in the other folder to replace it.</p>
                    <h5>Manual sync</h5>
                    <p>Enables the user to browse the files and folders on the remote device. Supports "put",
                    "get", "delete" and "make folder" operations.</p>
                    <a name="macos"><h2>Mac OS X</h2></a>
                    <a name="source"><h2>Source code</h2></a>
                    <h3>Python 2.7 for Windows XP/7/8/8.1, Linux</h3>
                    <p>It is possible to run the program on other platforms directly from
                    the source code. To do so, extract the source folder, open a
                    terminal/command-line utility, make the source folder your working directory
                    and type "python SyncBlue.py".</p>
                    <p>Make sure you are running the correct version of Python
                    (<a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/">Python 2.7</a>)
                    and install the following modules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/pybluez/downloads/list">PyBluez 0.20</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyOBEX/0.26">PyOBEX 0.26</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyqt/files/PyQt4">PyQt4</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the program does not launch or you are not able to connect to a device,
                    it is most likely that the Python Bluetooth libraries do not support your
                    system's Bluetooth stack.</p>
